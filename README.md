# AStarPathfindingAlgorithm
The PathFindingOnSquaredGrid framework towards shortest path finding by applying all three distance metrics as defined i.e., shortest path based on Manhattan distance, shortest path based on Euclidean distance, shortest path based on Chebyshev distance. Implementation can switch over these three distance metrics and produce, for each one, as output: a) visualisation of the shortest path on the squared grid, b) the total cost of the shortest path depending on the applied distance metric.
